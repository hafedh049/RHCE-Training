Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. Its architecture is designed to be simple and efficient, focusing on ease of use and scalability. Here’s a high-level overview of Ansible's architecture:

### Key Components

1. **Control Node** **(MASTER)** **(Ansible Node)**:
   - This is the machine where Ansible is installed and run. It is responsible for executing playbooks, managing inventories, and sending commands to managed nodes. The control node contains the Ansible command-line tools and Python libraries required for its operation.

2. **Managed Nodes** **(SLAVES)** **(Target Nodes)**:
   - These are the target systems or servers that Ansible configures or manages. Managed nodes do not need to have Ansible installed; they only need to have SSH access (or another connection method like WinRM for Windows systems) so that Ansible can communicate with them.

3. **Inventory**:
   - The inventory is a file (usually in INI or YAML format) that lists all the managed nodes. It can be static or dynamic, depending on whether it’s manually configured or generated by scripts or cloud providers. The inventory defines groups of nodes and their properties, which helps in organizing and targeting specific groups for configuration.

4. **Playbooks**:
   - Playbooks are YAML files that define a set of tasks to be executed on managed nodes. They describe the desired state of the system, including tasks like installing packages, copying files, and managing services. Playbooks are a central part of Ansible's configuration management and automation process.

5. **Modules**:
   - Modules are the units of work that Ansible uses to perform tasks on managed nodes. They are executed on the managed nodes by the control node. Ansible has a wide range of built-in modules for tasks like file manipulation, user management, and service handling. You can also create custom modules if needed.

6. **Tasks**:
   - Tasks are individual actions or operations defined within playbooks. Each task calls a module and specifies its parameters to perform a particular operation on the managed nodes.

7. **Roles**:
   - Roles are a way to organize and reuse playbooks. They provide a structured approach to grouping related tasks, variables, and handlers into reusable components. Roles help in managing complex configurations by modularizing the playbooks into smaller, manageable pieces.

8. **Variables**:
   - Variables in Ansible allow for the dynamic configuration of playbooks and roles. They can be defined in playbooks, inventory files, or separate variable files. Variables enable the customization of tasks and configurations based on different environments or conditions.

9. **Handlers**:
   - Handlers are special tasks in playbooks that are triggered by other tasks. They are usually used to restart services or perform actions that should only occur if a change is made, helping to ensure that tasks are executed only when necessary.

### Communication

- **SSH (for Linux/Unix systems)**:
  - Ansible uses SSH to connect to and manage Linux/Unix-based managed nodes. It does not require agents or additional software on the managed nodes, as it leverages SSH for communication.

- **WinRM (for Windows systems)**:
  - For Windows managed nodes, Ansible uses the Windows Remote Management (**WinRM**) protocol to execute commands and manage configurations.

Ansible’s architecture emphasizes simplicity, making it easy to use and deploy. Its agentless nature reduces overhead and simplifies management, while its modular approach provides flexibility and scalability for automation tasks.
