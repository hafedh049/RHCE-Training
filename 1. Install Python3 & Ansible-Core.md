Got it! Here’s a revised approach based on your requirements:

### 1. Install Python 3 on All Nodes

Ansible requires Python to be installed on all managed nodes. Here’s how to ensure Python 3 is installed:

1. **On Each Managed Node**, run:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y python3
   ```

### 2. Install Ansible Core on the Control Node

1. **On the Control Node**, first install Python 3 and pip if they are not already installed:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y python3 python3-pip
   ```

   Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   ansible --version
   ```

### 3. Create the `ansible` User on All Nodes

You can create the `ansible` user with the password `ansible` on both the control node and all managed nodes. Here’s how to do it:

#### **Manually Creating the User**

1. **On the Control Node**:

   ```bash
   sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash ansible
   echo "ansible:ansible" | sudo chpasswd
   ```

2. **On Each Managed Node**:

   SSH into each node run this & exit:

   ```bash
   sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash ansible
   echo "ansible:ansible" | sudo chpasswd
   ```

#### **Using Ansible to Create the User**

If you prefer to automate user creation with Ansible, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Ansible Playbook**

   Create a file named `create_ansible_user.yml`:

   ```yaml
   - name: Create ansible user on all nodes
     hosts: all
     become: yes
     # yes == true
     tasks:
       - name: Create ansible user
         user:
           name: ansible
           state: present
           shell: /bin/bash
           password: "{{ 'ansible' | password_hash('sha512') }}"
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `password: "{{ 'ansible' | password_hash('sha512') }}"`: This hashes the password `ansible` using SHA-512 before setting it.

2. **Run the Playbook**

   Make sure your inventory file is properly set up, then execute the playbook:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory_file_path create_ansible_user.yml
   ```

   Replace `inventory_file_path` with the path to your inventory file.

### Additional Notes

- **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create users on the nodes. You may need to run commands with elevated privileges.
- **Inventory Configuration**: Ensure your inventory file (`/etc/ansible/hosts` or another specified file) correctly lists all the managed nodes.
- **Security Considerations**: Be cautious when using plain text passwords. Consider using more secure methods for managing passwords in a production environment.

With these steps, you'll have Python 3 and Ansible Core installed, and the `ansible` user created on all nodes with the specified password.
