Ansible provides a set of system roles, known as *Red Hat System Roles*, that simplify the management of various aspects of a system's configuration, such as `timesync` and `selinux`. These roles are designed to be used with RHEL systems but can often be used with other distributions as well. Below are detailed steps on how to configure these system roles for `timesync` and `selinux`.

### Installing Red Hat System Roles

First, ensure that the `rhel-system-roles` package is installed on your control node:

```sh
sudo yum install rhel-system-roles
```

### Configuring `timesync` Role

The `timesync` role configures Network Time Protocol (NTP) on your systems. It supports both `chrony` and `ntpd` as backends.

#### Example Playbook for `timesync`

```css
- name: Configure time synchronization using timesync role
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  vars:
    timesync_ntp_servers:
      - hostname: time1.example.com
      - hostname: time2.example.com
    timesync_ntp_provider: chrony  # or ntp

  roles:
    - rhel-system-roles.timesync
```

#### Variables for `timesync`

- `timesync_ntp_provider`: Specifies the NTP provider (`chrony` or `ntp`).
- `timesync_ntp_servers`: List of NTP servers to use.
- `timesync_ntp_options`: Additional options for the NTP configuration.

### Configuring `selinux` Role

The `selinux` role configures SELinux settings on your systems.

#### Example Playbook for `selinux`

```css
- name: Configure SELinux using selinux role
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  vars:
    selinux_state: enforcing  # or permissive, disabled
    selinux_policy: targeted  # or mls

  roles:
    - rhel-system-roles.selinux
```

#### Variables for `selinux`

- `selinux_state`: Desired SELinux state (`enforcing`, `permissive`, or `disabled`).
- `selinux_policy`: SELinux policy to apply (`targeted` or `mls`).

### Complete Example Playbook Combining `timesync` and `selinux`

Hereâ€™s a playbook that configures both time synchronization and SELinux:

```css
- name: Configure time synchronization and SELinux
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  vars:
    # Variables for timesync
    timesync_ntp_servers:
      - hostname: time1.example.com
      - hostname: time2.example.com
    timesync_ntp_provider: chrony  # or ntp

    # Variables for selinux
    selinux_state: enforcing  # or permissive, disabled
    selinux_policy: targeted  # or mls

  roles:
    - rhel-system-roles.timesync
    - rhel-system-roles.selinux
```

### Running the Playbook

Save the playbook to a file, for example, `configure_system.yml`, and then run it with:

```css
ansible-playbook -i inventory_file configure_system.yml
```

### Inventory File Example

Your inventory file (`inventory_file`) might look like this:

```css
[all]
server1.example.com
server2.example.com
```

### Summary

By using Red Hat System Roles for `timesync` and `selinux`, you can simplify the management and configuration of these critical services across your RHEL environment. These roles provide a standardized and repeatable way to ensure your systems are correctly configured, improving both consistency and compliance.
