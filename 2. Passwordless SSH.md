If you want to set up passwordless SSH access without using Ansible playbooks and prefer to use `ssh-keygen` and `ssh-copy-id`, follow these steps:

### 1. Generate SSH Key Pair on the Control Node

First, generate an SSH key pair on your control node (if you don’t already have one). Open a terminal and run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Follow the prompts to save the key (usually at `~/.ssh/id_rsa`) and optionally set a passphrase for added security.

### 2. Copy the Public Key to Each Slave Node

Use `ssh-copy-id` to copy the public key to each slave node. The `ssh-copy-id` command simplifies the process of copying the public key to the remote host and adding it to the `authorized_keys` file.

Run the following command for each slave node:

```scss
ssh-copy-id ansible@slave1.example.com
ssh-copy-id ansible@slave2.example.com
ssh-copy-id ansible@slave3.example.com
```

Replace `user` with the appropriate username for the slave nodes and `slave1.example.com`, `slave2.example.com`, and `slave3.example.com` with the hostnames or IP addresses of your slave nodes.

### 3. Verify Passwordless SSH Access

After copying the key to all slave nodes, verify that you can SSH into each slave node without being prompted for a password:

```scss
ssh ansible@slave1.example.com
ssh ansible@slave2.example.com
ssh ansible@slave3.example.com
```

If you’re able to log in without entering a password, passwordless SSH is correctly set up.

### Additional Notes

- **Permissions**: Ensure that the `~/.ssh` directory and `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the slave nodes have the correct permissions (`700` for `.ssh` and `600` for `authorized_keys`).
- **SSH Configuration**: Ensure that the SSH service on the slave nodes is configured to allow key-based authentication. This is usually enabled by default, but you can check the `sshd_config` file (typically located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) for settings like `PasswordAuthentication` and `PubkeyAuthentication`.

By following these steps, you'll set up passwordless SSH access from your control node to the specified slave nodes.
