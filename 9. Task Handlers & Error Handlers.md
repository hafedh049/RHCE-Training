In Ansible, task handlers and error handlers are used to manage tasks in response to specific conditions during playbook execution. Here's an overview of how to use them:

### Task Handlers

Handlers are tasks that are run only when triggered by the `notify` directive in other tasks. They are useful for performing actions like restarting services only when changes have occurred.

#### Defining Handlers

Handlers are defined in a playbook under the `handlers` section.

#### Example Playbook with Handlers

```scss
- name: Example Playbook with Handlers
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Create configuration file
      template:
        src: my_httpd.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
      notify: Restart Apache

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
```

### Error Handlers

Error handlers are tasks that are executed when a failure occurs in a play. They are defined under the `rescue` and `always` blocks within a task.

#### Example Playbook with Error Handlers

```scss
- name: Example Playbook with Error Handlers
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install a package
      yum:
        name: non_existent_package
        state: present
      ignore_errors: yes
      register: result

    - name: Handle installation failure
      block:
        - name: Check if the package installation failed
          debug:
            msg: "Package installation failed"
          when: result.failed

        - name: Attempt to install another package
          yum:
            name: alternative_package
            state: present
      rescue:
        - name: Log the failure
          debug:
            msg: "Failed to install both packages"

      always:
        - name: Ensure package state is logged
          debug:
            msg: "Finished attempting to install packages"
```

### Complete Example with Both Handlers and Error Handling

Hereâ€™s a more comprehensive example combining both handlers and error handling:

#### Playbook

```scss
- name: Example Playbook with Handlers and Error Handling
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Create configuration file
      template:
        src: my_httpd.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Install a package that might fail
      yum:
        name: non_existent_package
        state: present
      ignore_errors: yes
      register: result

    - name: Handle possible failure
      block:
        - name: Check if the package installation failed
          debug:
            msg: "Package installation failed"
          when: result.failed

        - name: Attempt to install another package
          yum:
            name: alternative_package
            state: present
      rescue:
        - name: Log the failure
          debug:
            msg: "Failed to install both packages"

      always:
        - name: Ensure package state is logged
          debug:
            msg: "Finished attempting to install packages"

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
```

### Key Points

- **Handlers**: Run only when notified by the `notify` directive. Commonly used for actions like service restarts.
- **Error Handlers**: Run tasks in response to errors. Use `block`, `rescue`, and `always` to handle errors gracefully.

By using task handlers and error handlers effectively, you can create more robust and maintainable Ansible playbooks.
